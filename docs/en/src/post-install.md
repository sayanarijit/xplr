Post Install
============

Once [installed][1], use the following steps to setup and run xplr.

Create the customizable config file
-----------------------------------

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/xplr

version="$(xplr | grep ^version: | cut -d' ' -f 2)"

# When the app loads, press `#`

echo version = '"'${version:?}'"' > ~/.config/xplr/init.lua
```

Then
**[copy from here][2]**
and remove / comment out what you don't want to customize.

> **Note:** You don't generally need to create the config file. You can use the
> default configuration for basic operations. However, creating the config file
> is recommended because the project is in its early stage and the defaults
> might change. Creating the config file will save you from unexpected behavior
> when you [upgrade][3].
> Also, the default configuration is meant to be overwritten to suit your
> workflow.
