Introduction
============

`xplr` is a terminal UI based file explorer that aims to increase our terminal
productivity by being a flexible, interactive orchestrator for the ever growing
awesome command-line utilities that work with the file-system.

To achieve its goal, `xplr` strives to be a fast, minimal and more importantly,
hackable file explorer.

`xplr` is not meant to be a replacement for the standard shell commands or the
GUI file managers. Rather, it aims to integrate them all and expose an
intuitive, scriptable, keyboard controlled, real-time visual interface, also
being an ideal candidate for further integration, enabling the users to achieve
insane terminal productivity.
