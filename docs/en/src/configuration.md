# Configuration

xplr can be configured using [Lua][1] via a special file named `init.lua`,
which can be placed in `~/.config/xplr/` (local to user) or `/etc/xplr/`
(global) depending on the use case.

When xplr loads, it first executes the [built-in init.lua][2] to set the
default values, which is then overwritten by another config file, if found
using the following lookup order:

1. `--config /path/to/init.lua`
2. `~/.config/xplr/init.lua`
3. `/etc/xplr/init.lua`

The first one found will be loaded by xplr and the lookup will stop.

The loaded config can be further extended using the `-C` or `--extra-config`
command-line option.

## Config

The xplr configuration, exposed via `xplr.config` Lua API contains the
following sections.

See:

- [xplr.config.general](https://xplr.dev/en/general-config)
- [xplr.config.node_types](https://xplr.dev/en/node_types)
- [xplr.config.layouts](https://xplr.dev/en/layouts)
- [xplr.config.modes](https://xplr.dev/en/modes)

## Function

While `xplr.config` defines all the static parts of the configuration,
`xplr.fn` defines all the dynamic parts using functions.

See: [Lua Function Calls](https://xplr.dev/en/lua-function-calls)

As always, `xplr.fn.builtin` is where the built-in functions are defined
that can be overwritten.

#### xplr.fn.builtin.try_complete_path

Tries to auto complete the path in the input buffer

#### xplr.fn.builtin.fmt_general_selection_item

Formats each node in the selection

#### xplr.fn.builtin.fmt_general_preview_renderer

Renders the focused node in preview pane

See: [xplr.util.preview](https://xplr.dev/en/xplr.util#xplrutilpreview)

The focused node is passed as the node value, and layout_hight is passed
dynamically.
When there is no item under focus, the node value will be nil.

#### xplr.fn.builtin.fmt_general_table_row_cols_0

Renders the first column in the table

#### xplr.fn.builtin.fmt_general_table_row_cols_1

Renders the second column in the table

#### xplr.fn.builtin.fmt_general_table_row_cols_2

Renders the third column in the table

#### xplr.fn.builtin.fmt_general_table_row_cols_3

Renders the fourth column in the table

#### xplr.fn.builtin.fmt_general_table_row_cols_4

Renders the fifth column in the table

#### xplr.fn.custom

This is where the custom functions can be added.

There is currently no restriction on what kind of functions can be defined
in `xplr.fn.custom`.

You can also use nested tables such as
`xplr.fn.custom.my_plugin.my_function` to define custom functions.

## Hooks

This section of the configuration cannot be overwritten by another config
file or plugin, since this is an optional lua return statement specific to
each config file. It can be used to define things that should be explicit
for reasons like performance concerns, such as hooks.

Plugins should expose the hooks, and require users to subscribe to them
explicitly.

Example:

```lua
return {
  -- Add messages to send when the xplr loads.
  -- This is similar to the `--on-load` command-line option.
  --
  -- Type: list of [Message](https://xplr.dev/en/message#message)s
  on_load = {
    { LogSuccess = "Configuration successfully loaded!" },
    { CallLuaSilently = "custom.some_plugin_with_hooks.on_load" },
  },

  -- Add messages to send when the directory changes.
  --
  -- Type: list of [Message](https://xplr.dev/en/message#message)s
  on_directory_change = {
    { LogSuccess = "Changed directory" },
    { CallLuaSilently = "custom.some_plugin_with_hooks.on_directory_change" },
  },

  -- Add messages to send when the focus changes.
  --
  -- Type: list of [Message](https://xplr.dev/en/message#message)s
  on_focus_change = {
    { LogSuccess = "Changed focus" },
    { CallLuaSilently = "custom.some_plugin_with_hooks.on_focus_change" },
  }

  -- Add messages to send when the mode is switched.
  --
  -- Type: list of [Message](https://xplr.dev/en/message#message)s
  on_mode_switch = {
    { LogSuccess = "Switched mode" },
    { CallLuaSilently = "custom.some_plugin_with_hooks.on_mode_switch" },
  }

  -- Add messages to send when the layout is switched
  --
  -- Type: list of [Message](https://xplr.dev/en/message#message)s
  on_layout_switch = {
    { LogSuccess = "Switched layout" },
    { CallLuaSilently = "custom.some_plugin_with_hooks.on_layout_switch" },
  }

  -- Add messages to send when the selection changes
  --
  -- Type: list of [Message](https://xplr.dev/en/message#message)s
  on_selection_change = {
    { LogSuccess = "Selection changed" },
    { CallLuaSilently = "custom.some_plugin_with_hooks.on_selection_change" },
  }
}
```
